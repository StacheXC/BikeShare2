## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

You can add options to executable code like this

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
```

```{r}
library(vroom)
```

```{r}
library(dbarts)
```

```{r}
bikes = vroom("train.csv")
bikes_test = vroom("test.csv")
```

```{r}
bikes = bikes |> 
  select(-casual, -registered) |> 
  mutate(count = log(count))
```

```{r}
bike_recipe = recipe(count ~ ., bikes) |> 
  step_mutate(weather = ifelse(weather == 4, 3, weather)) |> 
  step_mutate(weather = as.factor(weather)) |> 
  step_time(datetime, features = "hour") |> 
  step_date(datetime, features = c("year")) |> 
  step_mutate(workingday_hour = workingday * datetime_hour) |> 
  step_mutate(season = as.factor(season)) |> 
  step_rm(datetime)
```

```{r}
model = parsnip::bart(trees = 100) |> 
  set_engine("dbarts") |> 
  set_mode("regression")
```

```{r}
bike_workflow = workflow() |> 
  add_recipe(bike_recipe) |> 
  add_model(model) |> 
  fit(data = bikes)
```

```{r}
lin_preds = predict(bike_workflow, new_data = bikes_test) |> exp()
```

```{r}
kaggle_submission = lin_preds |> 
bind_cols(bikes_test) |> 
  select(datetime, .pred) |> 
  rename(count=.pred) |> 
  mutate(datetime = as.character(format(datetime)))
```

```{r}
vroom_write(x = kaggle_submission,
            file = "./BartPreds.csv",
            delim = ",")
```
